Tool to predict stock prices 

Only for Testing. 

I created this tool to connect Alpha Vantage API to retrieve historical stock data for the past year, calculates daily returns and creates lagged variables for a linear regression model, trains the model on the data and makes predictions on the most recent 30 days of data. You will need to sign up for an API key from Alpha Vantage and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key. You will also need to replace AAPL with the desired stock symbol.
